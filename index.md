## Project Synopsis
Over the last 3 years RITâ€™s Program of Color Science has worked with Senior Project teams to develop Beyond RGB, a program that allows cultural heritage institutions to perform spectral imaging without the need for expensive equipment. Spectral imaging allows for more information about color detail to be recorded than is possible in traditional three channel RGB imaging tools. Our team will be working to iterate on and maintain this existing piece of technology for the duration of the project. This will entail a variety of bug fixes as well as implementing features to improve the usability of the program. Many of these features will focus on making the required data inputs for the preprocessing procedure more flexible. This will make it so users at cultural institutions that benefit from Beyond RGB will face fewer roadblocks when attempting to utilize the software. Our team will also explore implementing a new tagging system that would make importing reference data used in the spectral imaging process simpler. Additionally we will be evaluating implementations that will allow for arbitrary amounts of channels to be used in the spectral imaging process (which is currently limited to 6 channels). Outside of purely technical requirements we will also be updating the documentation for Beyond RGB as it currently exists to reflect the changes we will be making. This project will be of great benefit to smaller scale cultural institutions that can not afford expensive tools but still need to image and preserve visual media.
